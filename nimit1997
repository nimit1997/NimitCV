<li><p><strong>Advanced Fourier Transform Research Project</strong>(<em>May</em> '17-<em>Jun</em> '17)<br>
<em>Electrical Engineering Department, IIT-Bombay</em><br>
-Research on Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) and Generalized Time Frequency Transform (GTFT) based on different eigenvalue problems.<br>
-Designed a MATLAB code for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to detect a moving target on ground with different radial and tangential velocity as well as acceleration.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Microphone and Audio Amplifier Circuit</strong>(<em>March</em> '17-<em>Apr</em> '17)<br>
<em>Electrical Engineering Department, IIT-Bombay</em><br>
-Constructed a low-power audio amplifier based on the LM386 IC and a microphone circuit using a compact electret condenser microphone cartridge and operational amplifiers.<br>
-Studied the role of the summing network, tone control circuit, filters, rectifiers and other components.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Phase Sensitive Demodulator</strong>(<em>March</em> '17-<em>Apr</em> '17)<br>
<em>Electrical Engineering Department, IIT-Bombay</em><br>
-Built the breadboard construction of a phase sensitive demodulator circuit which is used for signal conditioning in electric instrument design and for communication to reduce the effect of noise.<br>
-The circuit consisted of a phase shifter, a switch based PSD and a low pass filter; studied the performance of the circuit and measured its dependency on the choice of components.</p></li>
  
<li><p><strong>Velocity of a moving object using Photodarlington</strong>(<em>Oct</em> 2016)<br>
<em>Course Project, IIT-Bombay</em><br>
-Built a circuit that allows to compute the velocity of a moving object using photodarlingtons.<br>
-Used RS latches to start and stop the timer count as and when the IR light got blocked by the moving object.<br>
-Used RC circuit as a timer to get accurate readings.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Music Synthesizer on Scilab</strong> (<em>March</em> 2017)<br>
<em>Course Project, IIT-Bombay</em><br>
-Developed program for a music synthesizer based on sampling from a sinusoid of required frequency.<br>
-Implemented features of adjustable timbre by making spectral modifications on notes for better quality of sound and that of fade-in fade-out temporal shaping for smoother transition between notes.<br>
-Verified the phenomena of aliasing caused by under-sampling of the waveform.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Hardware Interface of a Mixed Signal System</strong>(<em>Jan</em> '17<em>Apr</em> '17)<br>
<em>Course Project, IIT-Bombay</em><br>
-Developed a VHDL code for hardware interfacing of a mixed-signal system consisting of an ADC, an SRAM module and a DAC with a Altera MAX V complex programmable logic device (CPLD).<br>
-Captured the analog signal and wrote the output of the ADC in an SRAM; upon commanding, the signal read from the SRAM would be displayed on the oscilloscope after conversion using a DAC.<br>
-Interfaced the ADC0804, Hitachi Y62256A and DAC0808 chips with the Krypton CPLD board using various interface signal in VHDL hardware description language.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Magnus Plane | Institute Technical Summer Project (ITSP)</strong> (<em>May</em> 2016-<em>Jun</em> 2016)<br>
<em>Aero modelling Club, STAB, IIT-Bombay</em><br>
-Designed and conceptualized a plane which flies in the air due to magnus effect generated by two pair of rotating cylinders.  </p></li>

<li><p><strong>Hotel Room Pricing strategy in the Indian market</strong> (<em>Jun</em> '17-<em>July</em> '17)<br>
<em>Market Research and Data Analysis, IIM-Lucknow</em><br>
-Investigated prospective factors that drive the hotel room prices in the Indian Hotel Industry.<br>
-Analyzed probable factors using regression models to find statistical support to the developed hypothesis.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Airline Pricing</strong> (<em>May</em> '17-<em>Jun</em> '17)<br>
<em>Market Research and Data Analysis, IIM-Lucknow</em><br>
-Analyzed various factors to explain the difference in prices between an economy ticket and a premium-economy airline ticket from a classified data set using R programming.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Wearable device for easy ECG measurement |TATA Pro Engage Project</strong> (<em>Jul’</em> 2016-present)<br>
<em>IIT-Bombay</em><br>
-Innovative way of monitoring ECG and other heart related information.<br>
-A smart way to capture patients ECG and report it to a cloud platform.<br>
-Execute a doctor's login portal with registration number validation to maintain records.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Oil Spill Management Project</strong> (2011)<br>
<em>St. Xavier’s High School, Surat</em><br>
-Designed a unique model for scavenging the overturned oil in oceans with the least amount of pollution.<br>
-Designed a cost effective waste to best model based on the viscosity difference principle of oil and water.</p></li>
